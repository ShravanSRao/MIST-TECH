<h3>My experience</h3>
<br>
<p>This activity pushed me to learn Linux commands, which I had been lazy to learn, even though I had dual-booted my system before the meet was conducted. I used to just run to ChatGPT and use it to try and solve CTF questions, but I gained some confidence after completing this task. I have completed 12 questions so far, and I hope to continue. I will be documenting my initial thought process and how I tackled each question. I have checked solutions for some of them on YouTube when I got stuck </p>

<h3>Question 1: Level 0→ Level 1</h3>
<p>Just opened a file so nothing noteworthy.I used less to open the text file </p>
<b>Flag found</b>=ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If<br>
<b>The syntax</b><code>less ./-</code>

<h3>Question 2: Level 1→ Level 2</h3>
<p>I knew the ls, cd, and find commands, so as I learned cat, du, and file through these questions, I did some googling. I learned that to open a file that starts with a -, we have to use ./ before it and then run the simple command, which helped me get the correct answer.</p>
<b>Flag found</b>=<code>263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx</code><br>

<b>The syntax</b><code>cat ./-</code>

<h3>Question 3: Level 2→ Level 3</h3>
<p>The file had spaces between so just googled how to open those file .I learned that i have to put the file name inisde <code>"File name"</code></p>
<b>Flag found</b>=<code>MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx</code><br>
*<b>The syntax</b><code>file "spaces in this filename"</code></b><br> *<code>cat "spaces in this filename"</code>

<h3>Question 4: Level 3→ Level 4</h3>
<p>I learned that files hidden started with a dot <code>.file_name</code>so i used <code>ls -f</code> it showed the hiden ASCII file named <em>...Hiding-From-You  .  ..</em>i tried using the format <code>cat "...Hiding-From-You  .  .."</code> but it didn't work for some reason so i used nano command</p>
<b>Flag found </b>=<code>2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ</code><br>
<b>The syntax</b><code>nano ...Hiding-From-You  .  .. </code>
