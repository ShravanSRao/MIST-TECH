<h2>1)Over the wire</h2>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
<p>This activity pushed me to learn Linux commands, which I had been lazy to learn, even though I had dual-booted my system before the meet was conducted. I used to just run to ChatGPT and use it to try and solve CTF questions, but I gained some confidence after completing this task. I have completed 12 questions so far, and I hope to continue. I will be documenting my initial thought process and how I tackled each question. I have checked solutions for some of them on YouTube when I got stuck </p>

<h3>Question 1: Level 1 â†’ Level 2</h3>
<p>I knew the ls, cd, and find commands, so as I learned cat, du, and file through these questions, I did some googling. I learned that to open a file that starts with a -, we have to use ./ before it and then run the simple command, which helped me get the correct answer.</p>
