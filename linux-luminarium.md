<h2>2)Linux Luminarium</h2>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>For now i have completed 4/12 modules of Linux Luminarium and it is <em>sometime good and some time irritating</em>.Since i cleared a few levels of bandit ,Linux Luminarium has been easy so far.But i feel some questions are ambiguous and not clear so i got stuck in some questions.And when i have been stuck and i asked for help from one of my friend who has cleared all levels but even some of suggestions have not lead me anywhere :|.Like a command having the same logic works in his but doesnt work in mine so i have been more independent this time instead of just waiting for solutions .I have picked up on reading documentation a little bit ,but when the documentation is too big i still struggle a little bit </p>

<br>
<h3>Module 1</h3>

<p>Had 2 problems so solved it quickly</p><br>
<h3>Module 2</h3>
<p>This  module was irritating not because it was hard .I felt the question instrcutions were not specific ,in some problems i didnt even understand why got the flag.I got stuck in one of the question ,i felt the logic was right so i asked one of my friends who had completed the problem ,he said some comamnd which was identical to mine but i still ran his command it didnt work.But when i ran a similar command with some changes it worked.Such thingss made me hate this module </p>
<b>Things i learned :</b>
<ul>
  <li>Absolute path</li>
  <li>Relative path</li>
  <li>~</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>Module 3</h3>
<p>I breezed through this module excdept one question realted symbolic link : Linked list question ,i asked the same friend for help and turns out i had actually linked the files right but the format i wa trying to print the flag was wrong.I was running <code>cat /challenge/not-theflag</code> thinking the flag was a ascii file and since not-the-flag linked to flag ,but instead i had to just run <code>/challenge/not-the-flag</code> .Since i has learned grep command in bandit over the wire ,i easily solved this question without reading the documentation.I did revise rm file and ls -a [since i knew about these before i did not add these in thing i learned  ] </p>
<b>Things i learned :</b>
<ul>
  <li>Types of file</li>
  <li>Symbolic links : <code>ln -s [targeted_file] [pointer]</code></li>
  <li>Hard Links : <code>ln [targeted_file] [pointer]</code></li></ul>
<h3>Module 4</h3>
<p>Solved 6/7 problems .1 question left, i felt that the problem not solved yet is easy therfore investing more time to solve it</p>
<b>Things i learned :</b>
<ul>
  <li>man command</li>
  <li>Search through documentation using <code>/ , n,N</code></li>
  <li><code>man man</code> : Reading to just documentation is hard but reading to the whole thing is harder.I'm not quite comfortable so will revise again</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Work in progress,I have not completed this task yet,im really sorry and i will try to complete it as soon as spossible </p>
